# WTWR - What to Wear App

This React application uses the Weather API to suggest what to wear based on the temperature of your location.

## Improvements to Come

This project is in its beginning stages. It has the ability to add and delete items using React and a mock API. The next step is building my own RESTful API to work with the project.
